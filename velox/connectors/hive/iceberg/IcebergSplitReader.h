  /// Adapts the data file schema to match the table schema expected by the
  /// query.
  ///
  /// This method reconciles differences between the physical data file schema
  /// and the logical table schema, handling various scenarios where columns may
  /// be missing, added, or need special treatment.
  ///
  /// @param fileType The schema read from the data file's metadata. This
  /// represents the actual columns physically present in the Parquet/ORC file.
  /// @param tableSchema The logical schema defined in the catalog (e.g., from
  /// DDL). This represents the current table schema that queries expect.
  ///
  /// @return A vector of column types adapted to match the query's
  /// expectations, with appropriate type conversions and constant values set
  /// for missing or special columns.
  ///
  /// The method handles the following scenarios for each column in the scan
  /// spec:
  ///
  /// 1. Info columns (e.g., $path, $data_sequence_number, $deleted)
  ///    These are virtual columns that provide metadata about the file itself.
  ///    Values are read from hiveSplit_->infoColumns map and set as constant
  ///    values in the scanSpec so they're materialized for all rows.
  ///
  /// 2. Regular columns present in File:
  ///    Column exists in both fileType and readerOutputType. Type is adapted
  ///    from fileType to match the expected output type, handling schema
  ///    evolution where column types may have changed.
  ///
  /// 3. Columns missing from File:
  ///    a) Partition columns (hive-migrated tables):
  ///       Column is marked as partition key in hiveSplit_->partitionKeys.
  ///       In Hive-written Iceberg tables, partition column values are stored
  ///       in partition metadata, not in the data file itself. Value is read
  ///       from partition metadata and set as a constant.
  ///    b) Schema evolution (newly added columns):
  ///       Column was added to the table schema after this data file was
  ///       written. Set as NULL constant since the old file doesn't contain
  ///       this column.
